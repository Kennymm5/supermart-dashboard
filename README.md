## 💼 Suggestions

Since Nairboi was the top highest lead in Sales i 2024, we see the staff attendence was highest in Nairobi Branch in 2024 and vice verse. Therefore HR should increase more staff attendance in other Branches.

Management should insure there`s no stockout_flag, to increaese customer satisfaction and reduce customer complaints. Especially Groceries Products.
